# BORDERS: FARM
#  Purpose:
#    Prevents foreign players and entities from entering the map during a game, and prevents game 
#    players and entities from leaving, using the Farm boundaries.
#  End Effect:
#    TP's foreign players to the lobby, kills foreign entities entering or game entities leaving,
#    and uses the markers/farm function to keep game players in bounds.
#  Called by:
#    game/maps/farm, then itself
#  Additional notes:
#    The schedule condition is a bit redundant if we loop per second anyway since we already have
#    tick_seconds, but its equally redundant to check the map id in tick_seconds when we already do
#    that during map setup. At least this way, all map enum checks stay within the map files (making
#    it easier to add more maps in the future).
#    It may be possible to merge the border checks using predicate alternatives, though I'm not sure of
#    the performance impact. TODO (medium): Explore this.
