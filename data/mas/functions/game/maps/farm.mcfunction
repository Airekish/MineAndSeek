# SETUP: FARM
#  Purpose:
#    Handles all of the setup needed for the Farm map at round start.
#  End Effect:
#    Map is loaded via structure blocks, team spawnpoints are set, and music/effects/bounds are scheduled
#    to kick in as the round starts.
#  Called by:
#    game/state/start
#  Additional notes:
#    The map loading method is specific to our world. To decouple it, we would need to setblock a
#    structure block with nbt data rather than doing data merge. In fact, that may be more efficient
#    anyway. TODO (medium): Explore this.
#    Also, if we do decouple from the world, then the boundaries and spawnpoints would also need to be
#    decoupled.
#    Lastly, the schedules use 45s here to align with the start of the round, so this should be updated
#    if the time for Hunter spawn is updated too. Ideally we find a way to do music/effect stuff
#    all from the round start function using predicates. TODO (low): Return to this.
